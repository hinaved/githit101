I am using Git Bash and am trying a few things like making a 'commit' and 'push' to GitHub. I want to get out of the current directory C:\user\myUsername\app and land in the C:\user\myUsername folder.

What commands do I write in Git Bash?

What do you mean by "it doesn't work"? –

Note: cd.. works only in windows command prompt, whereas cd .. works almost everywhere - including (linux) bash and (my) Git bash. –
